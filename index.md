Hello!

Great seeing you here!

## About Me

**I am Kalaivani Kalyanasundaram**

I am a Risk & Protection Specialist at PayPal. I am currently pursuing a Master's in Data Science. I hope to use my knowledge and make a true impact as a data scientist!


## Work/Projects

1. **Blog post on airline safety: **
I created a blog post on airline safety using wix.com, which highlights many visuals. These visualizations were developed with PowerBI to highlight important information on Air Travel safety and how air travel is the safest mode of travel based on our dataset.

2. **Infographic on Airline Safety**: 
I have decided to make an infographic on airline safety. In this infographic, I have decided to compare the data over last 40 years on fatalities and incidents occurred with different airlines to show that airline safety has had fewer fatal incidents and is actually safer mode of travel in recent years. This infographic was made using Canva to provide a nice background to convey important information about Airline Safety

3. **Project for Hotel Recommendations**: 
I implemented a model to come up with Hotel Recommendations. I use the csv dataset and perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the Hotels to come up with optimal hotel recommendations based on the model. 

4. **Prediction on Heart Diseases (CVDs) Executive Summary**: 
Heart disease, known as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), is the leading cause of death in the United States and is estimated to be 32% of all deaths worldwide (Who Health Organization, 2022). With this in mind, it becomes apparent that early detection of CVDs is extremely important. CVDs are a group of disorders that affect the ability of the heart to function properly. So I decided to work on crisp DM methodology to identify data, analyze and accurately predict CVD models.

5. **Case study Report—Factors on Sales**: 
I have chosen to learn the sales record of different items in different regions. This study gives us an idea of the general requirement/demand of a particular item in a given region. Also, it helps to find the profitability and the number of units sold in a particular region. This case study further shows us the importance of several factors on sales for businesses.

6. **Project on Sales Record in a Particular Region**: 
Read the sales data and did some cleaning and created some subsets to determine the food products sale in different region. Also represented the results in different charts. Removed  the useless/unimportant features and ran a confusion matrix to find the accuracy of the results. This resulted in finding important factors affecting sales records.

7. **Dashboard on Airline safety using Power BI**: 
Created a dashboard on Airline safety using Power BI. The graph shows how the airline fatalities has decreased over the last 40 years. The modern technology and automation have improved the airline safety. Also, I compared the data with auto accidents in a small town in Cary,NC

8. **Video presentation on Airline safety**: 
Used Canva to record my 5 min presentation on Airline safety. Used a seque and explained the data to show how the safety improved in the last 40 years. Also the results shows how air safety was improved by technology to urge individuals to understand the evolution of air travel.

9. **Data Science Project on Austin Weather**: 
This Project used 2 different datasets. I pulled information from an openweather API to gain insight on Austin weather aside from a flat csv file named austin_weather.csv. Using this data, I created a user interface to learn more about Austin’s weather at any time or any date in various units.

10. **R Project to learn more about Covid vaccinations**: 
This project uses the R dyplr package to learn more about Covid vaccinations. During the pandemic, this project helped me learn more about the vaccination rate and statewide vaccination numbers throughout the pandemic.
